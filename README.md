# This open-source project is a Python-based implementation of Blackjack. Blackjack, also known as 21, is a popular card game where players aim to beat the dealer by having a hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over. This project provides a console-based Blackjack game that allows users to play against a computerized dealer.
# Interactive Gameplay: Users can play Blackjack against an AI-controlled dealer through a user-friendly console interface.
# Game Rules: The project enforces standard Blackjack rules, including card values, player decisions (hit, stand, double down, split), and dealer behavior (hit until reaching 17 or higher).
# Scoring and Betting: Players can place bets and keep track of their bankroll as they play, with support for win/loss tracking and betting strategies.
# Customization: The project allows for customization of game parameters, such as the number of decks used, betting limits, and AI dealer behavior.
# Statistics: Players can view statistics and game history to analyze their performance and improve their Blackjack skills.
